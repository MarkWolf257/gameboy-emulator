--NOTES--
read write accesses to sp register pointed memory is not wrapped in getters and setters
because only an idiot will try to push to read only memory.
In case it is needed in future all of those are in iblk3.h including ret and call.

write design decisions on
why iblk headers dont have any includes
use of static inline in headers


--INACCURACIES--
Pixel FIFO is not implemented;
lcdc, scroll, window position and palettes are logged every line,
while background, window and objects are mapped every frame.

DMA transfer doesn't make sure that access outside HRAM is blocked;
It just executes the transfer immediately and
hopes that the bug is not relied upon.
